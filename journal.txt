Thursday 4/10

I received the specifications today. Copied the starter code repo and made sure I could push my local changes to my GH. Then made sure able to view project via gh pages. 
Created idea to compare the restricted meta threats in Pokemon VGC as we approach the introduction of regulation I which will be in use for Worlds this year. Verified that I can get raw JSON from the PokeAPI.
Brainstormed basic idea for data storage, organization, and manipulation. Organized basic layout. Created a roadmap for success.
Of course my idea was going to be pokemon. It was always going to be. I can make anything about pokemon hahaha
