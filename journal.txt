Thursday 4/10

I received the specifications today. Copied the starter code repo and made sure I could push my local changes to my GH. Then made sure able to view project via gh pages. 
Created idea to compare the restricted meta threats in Pokemon VGC as we approach the introduction of regulation I which will be in use for Worlds this year. Verified that I can get raw JSON from the PokeAPI.
Brainstormed basic idea for data storage, organization, and manipulation. Organized basic layout. Created a roadmap for success.
Of course my idea was going to be pokemon. It was always going to be. I can make anything about pokemon hahaha

Saturday 4/11

yesterday I didn't make the journal so I will begin there. Yesterday I was able to end the day reading a pokemon from the json, using that data to populate the class, and display it. 
Today I made sure that I could do so with multiple pokemon. I then fixed some functions as I realized how important having an ordered list via an array would be (of the pokemon to be viewed).
Then I made the css and html skeletonsof the side menu.
So I am a little behind schedule but I was busier yesterday than I thought I would be. However, it turns out that I am not working tomorrow so instead of no work on this project, I can do a good amount. 
So now my goal for tomorrow is to have the functionality for ordering the list fully polished. I will also coplete the json list tomorrow. I will pivot from just restricted meta threats to meta threats as there are actually only about 10. I am hoping to get that number closer to 50 or so.
